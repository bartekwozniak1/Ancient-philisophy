"introduction": "Aristotle's *Rhetoric* is not simply a handbook for eloquent speaking, but a profound philosophical inquiry into the art of persuasion. It delves into the methods of influencing human judgment and decision-making, dissecting the components of effective communication and their ethical implications. This exploration reveals the intricate interplay between logic, emotion, and character in shaping beliefs and actions.",
"summary": {
"chapter_1": "Chapter 1 - Persuasion as a Counterpart to Dialectic: Unveiling the Shared Territory of Reason and Influence\nThe art of persuasion, much like the pursuit of logical reasoning, isn't confined to any specific scientific domain but is a universal human endeavor. Every person, to some extent, engages in discussions, defends their positions, and critiques the views of others. This inherent capacity can be refined, allowing one to understand why some persuasive attempts succeed through practice while others arise spontaneously. The core of rhetoric lies in its modes of persuasion; everything else is secondary. Historically, however, many treatises on rhetoric have neglected the core of rhetorical persuasion and have been focusing on rousing emotions like prejudice, pity and anger.\n\nEffective laws should delineate as much as possible, leaving minimal discretion to judges, owing to the difficulty of finding many individuals capable of sound legislative and judicial reasoning. Further, legislative is general and future oriented. Legal decisions are made swiftly, often influenced by personal biases, making it challenging to uphold justice. Judges should decide on specifics, like whether an event occurred, but broader issues of importance or justice should be predetermined by law. Previous writers dwelled on methods to sway judges, ignoring the true essence of rhetoric, the enthymeme. Political oratory, dealing with broader issues and personal interests, minimizes manipulative tactics compared to forensic oratory, where the focus on individual cases and external interests encourages emotional appeals. Rhetorical study, therefore, centers on persuasive modes, particularly the enthymeme, a form of syllogism. This form demands an understanding of both how arguments are constructed and the specific subject matter to which they apply.\n\nThe ability to grasp both truth and its semblance resides within the same faculty, reflecting the human inclination towards truth. Rhetoric is necessary because, without it, truth and justice may not prevail, highlighting the speaker's responsibility. Moreover, it enables persuasion in situations where purely logical arguments fall short, and it promotes a clear understanding of issues by enabling us to argue both sides. Unlike other arts, rhetoric and dialectic impartially address opposing conclusions, though truth and goodness naturally possess a persuasive edge. Finally, the ability to defend oneself through speech is uniquely human. This power, like any other, can be misused, but its potential for harm doesn't negate its intrinsic value. Rhetoric, akin to dialectic, transcends specific subjects, focusing not on absolute persuasion but on identifying the most effective means in any situation.\n\n\"Rhetoric may be defined as the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion.\" Instead of aiming for guaranteed success, its purpose is to uncover the most effective approaches, mirroring how medicine strives for health even when a complete cure is unattainable.",
"chapter_2": "Chapter 2 - The Three Pillars of Persuasion: Ethos, Pathos, and Logos in Action\nPersuasion, in its essence, functions as a form of demonstration, especially when a point is convincingly proven. Rhetorical proof often relies on the enthymeme, a type of syllogism best understood through a grasp of dialectic, which is the study of syllogisms. A clear understanding of truth, and its close approximations, is vital for mastering both the enthymeme and broader rhetorical strategies. While rhetoric shares similarities with dialectic, it also draws upon ethical and political studies, often masquerading as political science due to a lack of proper understanding or deliberate posturing.\n\nEffective persuasion hinges on three interconnected elements: the speaker's character (ethos), the emotional state of the audience (pathos), and the logical strength of the argument itself (logos). The first aspect, ethos, emphasizes the importance of credibility. We naturally trust individuals perceived as virtuous, particularly when certainty is elusive. This trust, however, shouldn't stem from preconceived notions but from the speaker's actual words during the presentation. Secondly, pathos, involves understanding and stirring the emotions of the audience. Judgements vary significantly depending on whether the audience is friendly or hostile, happy or sad. Finally, logos, concerns the logical soundness of the speech, the ability to demonstrate a truth, or at least an apparent truth, using arguments tailored to the specific situation.\n\nTo command these persuasive elements requires logical reasoning, insight into human character, and a deep understanding of emotionsâ€”their nature, causes, and how they are triggered. This reveals that rhetoric is intrinsically linked to both dialectic and ethical studies, even mirroring political science. The art of rhetoric, like dialectic, is not a science with a specific subject but a faculty for crafting arguments. Much like dialectic has induction and syllogism, rhetoric has examples and enthymemes. These tools, while distinct, serve similar purposes, demonstrating how particular cases support broader propositions. Understanding these tools is crucial for effective communication, and it is imperative to consider the contingency inherent in most rhetorical situations, where probabilities and signs, rather than absolute necessities, form the basis of arguments.",
"chapter_3": "Chapter 3 - Navigating the Arenas of Persuasion: Tailoring Arguments to Political, Forensic, and Ceremonial Contexts\nRhetoric reveals its versatility through three distinct branches, each determined by the role of the audience: political, forensic, and ceremonial. The political arena involves deliberation on future actions, urging either for or against a particular course, with expediency as the primary goal. The forensic setting focuses on past events, aiming to establish justice or injustice through accusation and defense. The ceremonial branch centers on the present, often involving praise or censure, evaluating actions in light of current values. Each type of oratory operates within a specific timeframe and strives towards a distinct end.\n\nThe political orator grapples with the future, advocating for actions based on their potential for good or harm, with all other considerations being secondary. Forensic orators, on the other hand, deal with the past, striving to establish the justice or injustice of completed actions. Finally, ceremonial orators focus on the present, celebrating or condemning individuals based on their current standing, although they may draw upon past events or speculate about the future.\n\nThese different aims influence the types of arguments employed. Political oratory emphasizes the possible and impossible, focusing on whether a proposed action can be achieved and its potential consequences. Forensic oratory, conversely, centers on whether an act occurred and its legality. Ceremonial oratory, while often focusing on the present, might also consider the past and future to reinforce its praise or blame. All three, however, must also address the relative magnitude of good or harm, justice or injustice, honor or dishonor, to strengthen their persuasive appeal.",
"chapter_4": "Chapter 4 - Deliberative Rhetoric: The Foundations of Political Persuasion and Governance\nPolitical oratory's core purpose revolves around advising on actions that are within human control, focusing on matters of deliberation rather than inevitable or impossible occurrences. This type of oratory aims to influence decisions on crucial aspects of public life, such as financial resources, war and peace, national defense, trade, and legislation. The effective political speaker must possess a comprehensive understanding of these areas, enabling them to propose informed and beneficial policies. For instance, a speaker addressing financial matters should be familiar with the state's revenues and expenditures, identifying potential improvements or reductions.\n\nRegarding war and peace, knowledge of the state's military strength, both actual and potential, as well as that of neighboring states, is crucial. This understanding includes awareness of past conflicts and their outcomes, providing valuable insights for future strategic decisions. National defense requires knowledge of existing fortifications, strategic locations, and the overall geography of the territory, ensuring the security of the state. The food supply demands understanding of domestic production, import needs, and potential trade agreements, guaranteeing the stability of the population. Finally, expertise in legislation is paramount, as it underpins the welfare of the state. This involves knowledge of various constitutional forms, their strengths and weaknesses, and the factors that contribute to their success or failure. These different scenarios are not a part of the art of rhetoric, but more instructive arts.\n\n\"The main matters on which all men deliberate and on which political speakers make speeches are some five in number: ways and means, war and peace, national defence, imports and exports, and legislation.\" This comprehensive understanding, while drawing upon historical and comparative analysis ultimately falls under the domain of political science, not solely rhetoric.",
"chapter_5": "Chapter 5 - Defining the Good: Happiness, Virtue, and the Aims of Human Action\nHuman actions are inherently driven by a pursuit of happiness and its constituent elements. Defining happiness becomes crucial for effective deliberation, as all advice revolves around achieving or avoiding actions that impact this ultimate goal. Happiness can be understood as a combination of prosperity and virtue, independence, secure enjoyment of pleasure, or a flourishing state of both personal and external well-being. Its key components include noble birth, strong friendships, financial security, good children, a healthy old age, physical well-being, fame, honor, good fortune, and virtue. These elements, encompassing both internal qualities and external circumstances, contribute to a fulfilling and secure life.\n\nGood birth, for instance, signifies a lineage of distinguished individuals admired for their virtues or achievements. Similarly, having good and numerous children reflects both physical and moral excellence, encompassing beauty, strength, temperance, and courage. Wealth, on the other hand, involves the possession of abundant resources, including property, livestock, and slaves, used primarily for enjoyment and productive purposes. Fame stems from being respected, possessing qualities desired by others, while honor is a testament to one's capacity for doing good, either through preserving life, providing wealth, or other valuable contributions.\n\nPhysical excellence encompasses health, beauty, strength, and athletic prowess, varying across different stages of life. Happiness in old age involves a slow and painless decline, dependent on both physical well-being and good fortune. Friendship, defined as consistently striving for another's good for their sake, is a crucial element, with good friends being those who share this benevolent intention. Finally, good luck involves acquiring things that often cause envy, things that are caused by nature, or those that occur unexpectedly. Virtue, being closely connected with eulogy, will be analyzed later.",
"chapter_6": "Chapter 6 - Comparative Goodness and Utility: Navigating Choices and Values\nPolitical oratory's core function is to advise on the utility of actions, focusing on means rather than ends. Defining goodness and utility becomes crucial for effective persuasion. A good thing can be understood as something chosen for its own sake, sought by all beings with sensation or reason, or prescribed by reason itself. It is also that which brings about a self-sufficient and satisfactory condition, producing, maintaining, or entailing such characteristics while preventing their opposites. This definition allows us to identify various goods, including the acquisition of good things, the removal of bad things, and the preference for greater goods over lesser ones. \n\nVirtue is inherently good, leading to a flourishing state and producing beneficial actions. Pleasure, too, is a good, as it is the natural aim of all living beings. Specific goods include happiness, justice, courage, temperance, magnanimity, magnificence, health, beauty, wealth, friendship, honor, reputation, and the faculties of speech and action. Even life itself, regardless of other benefits, is considered a good, along with justice, which benefits the community. In cases where the goodness of something is disputed, various arguments can be employed. For instance, something is good if its opposite is bad, or if its opposite benefits our enemies. Also, things not in excess are good, while those exceeding proper measure are bad.\n\nEffort and expense invested in something often indicate its goodness, making it appear as an end achieved through significant means. Things widely sought after, praised, or valued even by enemies are generally considered good. Additionally, deliberate choices, actions benefiting friends or harming enemies, and things within our capabilities are often deemed good. Success, achievements aligned with our nature and experience, and things desired also fall under this category. Ultimately, identifying goodness relies on understanding what different individuals and groups value, providing the foundation for persuasive arguments.",
"chapter_7": "Chapter 7 - Degrees of Goodness: Establishing Value Hierarchies in Rhetoric\nWhen faced with choices between seemingly good options, understanding the relative degrees of goodness becomes crucial. A greater good can be defined as exceeding another, containing it as a part within a whole. Therefore, a larger number of goods generally surpasses a smaller number, especially if the smaller number is included within the larger. This principle extends to classes of things: if the largest member of one class surpasses the largest member of another, the entire class is considered superior. Similarly, a good always accompanied by another is greater than one that is not, as the use of the second is implicitly contained within the first.\n\nMoreover, something productive of a greater good is itself greater. A thing desirable in itself surpasses one not desirable in itself. An end is greater than a means, and something self-sufficient is greater than something dependent on others. Beginnings and causes are also considered greater than their effects, as nothing can exist without them. Rarity often elevates the perceived value of something, as does difficulty. Conversely, abundance and ease can also be argued as superior due to their greater utility. The importance of a thing is further emphasized by the severity of its opposite or the magnitude of its loss. Positive goodness surpasses the mere absence of badness, and noble or base functions indicate the goodness or badness of their respective sources.\n\nSuperiority in qualities like keenness of sight or love of friends elevates the corresponding attribute. Things judged good by wise individuals, by the majority, or by experts are often deemed superior. This aligns with the definition of good as what beings with understanding would choose. Furthermore, things associated with better individuals, either absolutely or in virtue of their goodness, are considered better. The nobler thing is preferred over the less noble, and lasting or secure things surpass fleeting or insecure ones. Finally, what is chosen by all or by the majority often holds greater value, as does what is deemed better by competitors, enemies, judges, or those they represent. These various criteria provide a framework for establishing hierarchies of value in rhetorical arguments.",
"chapter_8": "Chapter 8 - Understanding Constitutions: The Key to Effective Political Discourse\nSuccess in political persuasion hinges on a deep understanding of different forms of government, their customs, institutions, and interests. This knowledge is crucial because individuals are persuaded by what aligns with their perceived interests, which are inherently tied to the maintenance of the existing political order. The supreme authority, responsible for authoritative decisions, varies depending on the form of government, mirroring the diversity of constitutional structures. These structures can be broadly categorized as democracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, and monarchy, each possessing unique characteristics and aims.\n\nDemocracy distributes state offices by lot, while oligarchy relies on property qualifications. Aristocracy emphasizes education, defined as adherence to established laws and institutions, with those deemed 'the best men' holding power. Monarchy, on the other hand, concentrates authority in a single individual, either limited by prescribed conditions, as in kingship, or unlimited, as in tyranny. Each form of government pursues distinct ends: democracy prioritizes freedom, oligarchy wealth, aristocracy the preservation of education and institutions, and tyranny the protection of the ruler. Understanding these aims is essential for identifying the customs, institutions, and interests that support each constitution, as individuals choose means that align with their desired ends.\n\nFurthermore, effective persuasion relies not only on logical arguments but also on establishing the speaker's credibility. This involves demonstrating goodness, goodwill towards the audience, or both. Understanding the moral qualities characteristic of each form of government is, therefore, vital for tailoring persuasive appeals to specific audiences. These qualities are revealed through deliberate acts of choice, which are ultimately determined by the end pursued by each form of government. A grasp of these ends, along with the objects and grounds of persuasion in political oratory, provides the foundation for effective communication within any political system.",
"chapter_9": "Chapter 9 - Virtue and Vice, Nobility and Baseness: Cornerstones of Praise and Blame\nPraise and blame, integral to ceremonial oratory, center on the concepts of virtue and vice, the noble and the base. Understanding these concepts is crucial not only for evaluating actions but also for shaping the audience's perception of the speaker's character. The noble is defined as something desirable for its own sake and worthy of praise, inherently good and pleasant because of its goodness. Virtue, therefore, is inherently noble, being both good and praiseworthy. It is generally understood as a faculty for providing and preserving good things, conferring benefits on all occasions.\n\nThe various forms of virtue include justice, courage, temperance, magnificence, magnanimity, liberality, gentleness, prudence, and wisdom. Those virtues most beneficial to others, such as justice and courage, are often held in highest esteem. Justice ensures everyone enjoys their rightful possessions according to law, while courage enables individuals to perform noble deeds in times of danger. Liberality involves selfless generosity, while magnanimity focuses on doing good on a grand scale. Magnificence, on the other hand, concerns greatness in matters of expenditure.\n\nPrudence, a virtue of the understanding, enables wise decisions related to happiness. Noble actions are those stemming from virtue, signifying its presence and leading to its effects. These include acts of courage, justice, and temperance, as well as actions rewarded solely with honor, actions performed for the sake of others, and actions benefiting one's country without personal gain. Conversely, actions opposite to those that evoke shame are considered noble, as are actions aimed at avenging oneself, securing victory, or achieving things worthy of remembrance. We should also consider as noble actions those things which are associated with people of higher status. Furthermore, we must emphasize the intentionality of the noble actions.\n\nEncomium focuses on actual deeds, while praise emphasizes the underlying qualities that produce them. To persuade, one must demonstrate that actions stem from virtuous intentions, highlighting coincidences and accidents as deliberate choices. The audience's perception of the speaker's character can be shaped by aligning their actions with esteemed qualities, drawing parallels between seemingly disparate traits, and emphasizing those virtues valued by the specific audience. Ultimately, understanding the nature of virtue and vice, the noble and the base, provides the foundation for both effective praise and effective censure.",
"chapter_10": "Chapter 10 - Accusation and Defense: Unveiling the Dynamics of Wrongdoing\nAccusation and defense, central to forensic oratory, hinge on understanding the motivations, states of mind, and targets of wrongdoing. Defining wrongdoing is crucial for analyzing legal disputes. It can be understood as voluntary injury inflicted contrary to law, with law being either specific to a community or universally acknowledged. Voluntary actions stem from conscious choice, driven by either vice or lack of self-control. The specific wrongs committed often correspond to the individual's particular flaws, such as greed leading to financial misconduct or anger leading to violence.\n\nUnderstanding the motivations behind wrongdoing requires analyzing what individuals seek or avoid. Prosecutors must identify which potential motives might have driven the accused, while defendants must demonstrate the absence of such motives. Actions not stemming from an individual's own agency can be attributed to chance, necessity, or compulsion. Those originating from the individual are driven by either habit or craving, which can be rational (seeking good) or irrational (driven by anger or appetite). Every action, therefore, is caused by one of seven factors: chance, nature, compulsion, habit, reasoning, anger, or appetite. While age, moral state, and other factors influence actions, they are ultimately rooted in these seven causes.\n\nFurther analysis reveals that actions driven by rational craving aim at what is perceived as good, while irrational cravings are linked to anger and appetite. All actions due to oneself are either good or pleasant, or seemingly so. Consequently, all voluntary actions must be, or appear to be, good or pleasant. The prosecutor must identify the motives that affected his adversary, and the defendant must prove those motives did not drive his actions.",
"chapter_11": "Chapter 11 - The Nature of Pleasure: Understanding Human Motivation and Persuasion\nPleasure, a crucial element in understanding human motivation, can be defined as a conscious movement of the soul towards its natural state of being, while pain is its opposite. This definition suggests that things promoting this natural state are pleasant, while those hindering it are painful. Moving towards a natural state, particularly when it involves complete recovery, is generally pleasant. Habits, too, become pleasant, as they acquire a semblance of nature, with frequent occurrences resembling natural events. Conversely, forced or compulsory actions are painful, leading to the pleasantness of ease, relaxation, amusement, rest, and sleep, all free from compulsion.\n\nDesire, being a craving for pleasure, further contributes to the understanding of pleasant things. Irrational desires, stemming from no particular opinion, include natural cravings like hunger, thirst, and those related to taste, touch, smell, hearing, and vision. Rational desires, on the other hand, are induced by external influences and beliefs. Memory and expectation, being accompanied by sensation, can also be sources of pleasure, as they involve imagining past or future pleasant experiences. Even anger can be pleasant due to the anticipation of revenge. Victory, too, is pleasant, as it fulfills the desire for superiority, extending to competitive activities and games.\n\nHonor and good reputation are among the most pleasant things, creating a sense of being valued. Friendship, both giving and receiving love, is also pleasant, as is admiration. Repeated actions, learning, and wondering at things also fall under the category of pleasant experiences. Conferring and receiving benefits are pleasant, as they imply possession and superiority, and aiding others aligns with this. Acts of imitation, like painting, sculpture, and poetry, are pleasant, even if the object imitated is not inherently so, due to the learning process involved. Ultimately, understanding the nature of pleasure and its diverse sources provides valuable insights for crafting persuasive arguments.",
"chapter_12": "Chapter 12 - The Psychology of Wrongdoing: States of Mind, Victims, and Opportunities\nIndividuals engage in wrongdoing when they believe they can do so successfully, either escaping detection, avoiding punishment, or ensuring that the consequences are less severe than the potential gains. This belief is often fueled by eloquence, practical ability, legal experience, extensive social networks, or wealth, particularly if the individual possesses these advantages personally or through associates. A strong relationship with victims or judges can also contribute to this perception, as it might lead to leniency or avoidance of prosecution. Conversely, individuals with contradictory appearances, such as a weakling accused of assault, might be less likely to be suspected.\n\nOpen and egregious crimes are sometimes committed precisely because they are unexpected, leaving potential victims unprepared. Similarly, crimes of unprecedented magnitude might be overlooked due to their sheer audacity. Individuals with either no enemies or many enemies might feel secure, the former because they are unwatched, the latter because they seem unlikely targets. The ability to conceal the crime, either through its method, location, or disposal, also encourages wrongdoing. Furthermore, the prospect of avoiding trial, postponing it, corrupting judges, or evading penalties due to financial hardship can motivate individuals to act unlawfully.\n\nThe potential gains, whether significant, certain, or immediate, might outweigh the perceived risks. The belief that punishment is merely nominal, or that the crime might even bring credit, can also contribute. Conversely, individuals might be driven by the immediacy of pain and loss, while pleasure and profit seem distant. Habit, either through repeated success or repeated failure, can further encourage wrongdoing. Finally, the anticipation of pleasure or the avoidance of pain can motivate individuals to act against their better judgment. These factors, while complex, provide valuable insights into the mindset of individuals who engage in wrongdoing, revealing the interplay of beliefs, perceptions, and motivations.",
"chapter_13": "Chapter 13 - Justice and Injustice: Defining the Boundaries of Right and Wrong\nJust and unjust actions can be classified based on their relation to law and the individuals they affect. Law can be particular, specific to a community, or universal, reflecting the natural law that binds all individuals, regardless of their specific social context. This natural law, often intuitively understood, transcends specific legal codes. Sophocles' *Antigone* exemplifies this with Antigone's justification for burying her brother, defying Creon's decree but upholding a higher, natural law. Similarly, Empedocles advocates against killing living creatures, arguing that this is not merely a matter of particular laws but a universal principle. The concept extends to Alcidamas' words in his Messeniac Oration.\n\nActions, both just and unjust, can be directed either towards the community as a whole or towards specific individuals. For instance, adultery or assault harms a particular person, while avoiding military service harms the community. Wrongdoing, to be considered such, must involve intentional injury, inflicted voluntarily and contrary to law. This intentionality distinguishes criminal acts from mere mistakes or misfortunes. Understanding the various forms of harm, as previously discussed in relation to goods and evils, is crucial for analyzing such actions.\n\nEvery accusation, therefore, must address whether an action affects the community or an individual, and whether it was done intentionally or unintentionally. If intentional, it must be determined whether the act stemmed from deliberate choice or passion. The specific motives and states of mind involved in wrongdoing have already been explored. Disputes often arise not over the act itself but over its legal definition and implications, requiring a clear understanding of concepts like theft, outrage, and adultery to establish either guilt or innocence. Ultimately, the determination of justice or injustice hinges on deliberate purpose, not merely on the act itself.",
"chapter_14": "Chapter 14 - Degrees of Wrongdoing: Assessing Moral Responsibility and Harm\nThe severity of wrongdoing is often determined by the underlying disposition of the perpetrator, with the most trifling acts potentially revealing the greatest moral flaws. This is because the greater encompasses the lesser; an individual willing to commit a minor offense would likely not hesitate to commit a more serious one. However, the magnitude of harm caused can also influence the assessment of wrongdoing. Actions for which no adequate punishment exists, or those causing incurable harm, are considered more severe. Similarly, if the victim has inflicted significant harm upon themselves, the perpetrator's responsibility might be perceived as even greater.\n\nThe uniqueness of the crime, whether committed for the first time or repeatedly, can also impact its severity. Actions that lead to the creation of new laws or punishments to prevent their recurrence are deemed particularly egregious. Furthermore, the brutality or deliberateness of the crime, as well as the terror it inspires, can heighten its perceived severity. Rhetorical devices, such as highlighting the violation of multiple obligations or committing the crime in a place of justice, can further amplify the impact. Conversely, actions that break unwritten laws of justice, reflecting a higher moral standard, might be considered less severe than those violating written laws, which rely on external enforcement.\n\nUltimately, assessing the degree of wrongdoing involves considering a multitude of factors, including the perpetrator's disposition, the harm caused, the uniqueness of the act, and the broader societal implications. Rhetorical strategies can be employed to emphasize or downplay these factors, shaping the audience's perception of moral responsibility and influencing their judgment.",
"chapter_15": "Chapter 15 - Non-Technical Means of Persuasion: Laws, Witnesses, Contracts, Tortures, and Oaths\nBeyond the core arguments themselves, rhetoric employs 'non-technical' means of persuasion, particularly relevant in forensic oratory. These include laws, witnesses, contracts, tortures, and oaths, each serving a distinct function in shaping the audience's perception of the case.\n\nLaws can be used both for and against a particular argument. If the written law contradicts one's case, appealing to universal law, emphasizing equity and justice, becomes crucial. One might argue that a juror's oath to judge honestly transcends the literal interpretation of a written law, or that principles of equity are permanent and unchanging, unlike specific legal codes. Highlighting contradictions between different laws, or ambiguities within a single law, can also be effective. Conversely, if the written law supports one's case, emphasizing its authority and the importance of upholding legal principles becomes paramount.\n\nWitnesses are categorized as ancient, referring to poets and notable figures whose judgments are widely respected, and recent, those with direct knowledge of the case. Recent witnesses can further be divided into those who share the risk of the trial and those who do not. Arguments concerning witnesses involve questioning their credibility, highlighting potential biases, or emphasizing the consistency of their testimony with established probabilities.\n\nContracts, like laws, can be used to support or challenge a particular claim. Emphasizing the binding nature of contracts and their importance for social order strengthens their persuasive power. Conversely, challenging the validity of a contract, highlighting potential fraud, coercion, or contradictions with other laws or contracts, weakens its influence.\n\nTorture, while a controversial form of evidence, can be used strategically. Arguing for its reliability might involve emphasizing its compulsory nature, while challenging it might involve highlighting the potential for false confessions under duress, citing historical examples of its unreliability.\n\nOaths, too, can be employed in various ways. One might refuse to offer or accept an oath, arguing that individuals are prone to perjury or that the risk of an unfavorable verdict is preferable to violating one's conscience. Conversely, one might offer or accept an oath, emphasizing one's commitment to truth and trust in divine judgment. Ultimately, the strategic use of these non-technical means of persuasion, tailored to the specific circumstances of the case, can significantly influence the outcome of a rhetorical encounter.",
